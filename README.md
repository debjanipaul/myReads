## Description
This Project was created as part of React Nanodegree Program

## About Project
I was provided the starter code that included the HTML and CSS for myReads. I built components to show the main page and search page for the project using react router. The app allows user to move books around different shelves in the main page. Once they navigate to the search page the users can search for more books which gets populated using an API. They can add the books to respective shelves from the search page and when they navigate nack to main page they should be able to see the books in the right shelf.

## How to run the App?
